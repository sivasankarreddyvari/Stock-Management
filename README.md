# Stock-Management
Stock Management in JAVA
Project Plan:

1. Stores  : user can add store, edit store, and listing all the available stores

2. Categories: user can add/modify categories : this we will  use while adding products

3. Products:
a. user can add products. while adding products user can select categories (dropdown) and multiple stores (multiple select dropdown). So the user can add same product to single store or multiple stores (this case if product1 creating with store1 and store2 means, it will insert the 2 records with same product details and different store id in product table. Later can edit particular store product to maintain stock or price etc.,)
	a. Listing products : Lists all the products for all the stores
	b. Search: can search product name with store and product name
